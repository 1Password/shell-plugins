## Changelog
<!--  
A one line sentence describing the change that this PR introduces. 
If this has impact over the user experience, your changelog will be included in the release notes of the next stable version of 1Password CLI.

Here are a few guidelines for writing a good changelog:
- Keep your description to a single sentence if you can, and use proper capitalization and punctuation, including a final period.
- Don't use emoji in your description.
- Avoid starting your sentence with "improved" or "fixed". Instead, describe the improvement or say what you fixed.
- Avoid using terminology like "Users are shown" or "You can now" and instead focus on the thing that was changed.

A few examples:

Authenticate the AWS CLI using Touch ID and other unlock options with 1Password Shell Plugins.
The AWS plugin can now be correctly initialized with a default credential, using `op plugin init`.
The AWS plugin now checks for the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable and attempts to import credentials using the specified file.
